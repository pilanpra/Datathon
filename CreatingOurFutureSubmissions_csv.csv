7,Irelands agri-sector contributes greatly to climate change & biodiversity loss however much of the sector produces products for export while the country imports food that used to be grown in Ireland.

13,"What the question ought to be how researchers in Ireland can perform their research. In 2018 Irish expenditure on R & D was 1.14% of GDP, this is pathetically low for a developed country and is half of the world average spend on research. Questioning ""what researchers in Ireland can do"" is pointless unless they are funded. The dual role of the DG of the SFI also being the CSA to the government is also a nonsense.",30-39,Galway

Use libraries and local community spaces to engage with and relate to the general public.",,
29,My idea is that the State fund's researchers working in our universities & colleges to pursue what they are interested in & for that research not to be driven by preconceived impacts.

The absence of a clear definition of mental health has very practical consequences when we consider what precisely is meant by ‘normality.’ Research could contribute greatly to establishing a sound philosophical basis for a truly integral human psychology that is applicable across disciplines.
